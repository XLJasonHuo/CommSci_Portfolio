    <h3>
      Hey there, welcome to my website :) My name is Jason Huo, I'm a aspired computer science beginner, 
      I'm planning to enhance my skills and abilities at Computer Science related subjects post-secondary. Over this quadmester, I've
      lerned many technologies/techniques from multiple different languages. In this website, I'll showcase
      some of the projects and challenges I've done and obstacles I came across. Outside of the world of coding, I'm a person that loves
      to go outside, I love soccer/football, cars are my passion. This website will also cover my top 10 personal favorite projects
      during my time in Khan Academy and other applications. A paragrah/s of summary will follow each project, this will include my thoughts on 
      I would use this technique/technology to learn future Computer Science subjects; How and what aspects of the moduule made the most impact
      as a student. Without further ado, let's dive into the world of coding. ;) (OH ONE MORE THING, Please click on the Subscribe button on the
      top right of the website :) )

    <!--All projects-->
    <h2 id = "content">Top 10 Projects</h2>
                      
    <!--Project: Shooting Star-->
    <h1 class = "project">Project: Shooting Star</h1>
    <h2 class="spin-off"><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/spin-off-of-project-shooting-star/6402075491254272">Spin-off of "Project: Shooting star"</a></h2><script src="https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/spin-off-of-project-shooting-star/6402075491254272/embed.js?editor=yes&buttons=yes&author=yes&embed=yes"></script><p>Made using: <a href="http://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming">Khan Academy Computer Science</a></p>
    <h3 class="summary">
      When I started this Shooting Star project, I didn't have much knowledge for JS, I only knew simple statements such as ellipse, fill. Over
      the course of this project, I learned how to put these statements into functions, and use them to create interesting animations. In this case,
      I created two stars shooting towards the center from the top left and right corner. After this project, I was more motivate to continue, because
      I've always liked animation, but did not have the knowledge to put all the codes together. I recommend beginner programmers to try this project.

    <h3 class="summary">
      In life, I would consider myself a good cook. Due to the popularity of internet, I think is important to understand how to create a recipe Book
      online to share my ideas. This project helped me to develop my web design ability, which I display by using hyperlinks, color styles, table row.
      I think this project is significant because this will help you develop the fundamentals of web designing.

    <!--Project: Hoppy Beaver Extreme-->
    <h1 class = "project">Project: Hoppy Beaver Extreme</h1>  
    <h2 class="spin-off"><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/spin-off-of-project-hoppy-beaver-extreme/5399617630322688">Spin-off of "Project: Hoppy Beaver Extreme"</a></h2><script src="https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/spin-off-of-project-hoppy-beaver-extreme/5399617630322688/embed.js?editor=yes&buttons=yes&author=yes&embed=yes"></script><p>Made using: <a href="http://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming">Khan Academy Computer Science</a></p>
    <h3 class="summary">
      I like challenges in games, during this project, I added an obstacle to the game where, Beaver must avoid catching the red pipes. If user catched the red pipes, 
      their score to decrease 1, the score can also go negative, Users must be cautious of their moves. The idea of the project is to add challenges to JS games, this 
      is important for beginner game developers, like I said earlier, I think that games should include challenges to increase the interest of their player base.

    <!--Project: Asteroids Spaceship-->
    <h1 class = "project">Project: Asteroids Spaceship</h1>  
    <h2 class="spin-off"><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/spin-off-of-project-asteroids-spaceship/5380677470470144">Spin-off of "Project: Asteroids spaceship"</a></h2><script src="https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/spin-off-of-project-asteroids-spaceship/5380677470470144/embed.js?editor=yes&buttons=yes&author=yes&embed=yes"></script><p>Made using: <a href="http://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming">Khan Academy Computer Science</a></p>
    <h3 class="summary">
      During the course of the Asteroids Spaceship project, I ran into obstacles such as, spaceship won't dispaly again if it passed the edge of the canvas; Due
      to the fact that I did not have physics, I had a hard to learning Natural simulations in general. However, I went throguh all the practices, challenges, this 
      project is one of the examples of my work. Like I said earlier, I think that this project is more advanced, if beginner programmers think that they're ready,
      they should try out this project and Natural Simulations in general. I think this is a good course and project to test what I've learned so far.

    <!--Project: BuildAHouse-->
    <h1 class = "project">Project: Build A House</h1>  
    <h2 class="spin-off"><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/spin-off-of-project-build-a-house/4519531640471552">Spin-off of "Project: Build-a-House"</a></h2><script src="https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/spin-off-of-project-build-a-house/4519531640471552/embed.js?editor=yes&buttons=yes&author=yes&embed=yes"></script><p>Made using: <a href="http://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming">Khan Academy Computer Science</a></p>
    <h3 class="summary">
      In my opinion, the main idea of this project is to for beginner programmers understand and use simple statements such as: fill, while loop, shape commands to
      form an object, in this case a house. This can help begineers to use loops to draw simple objects and, insert image links to combine with the object you created.

    <h3 class="summary">
      I used to play magic 8 ball with my friends, it was entertaining, hence why I picked this project. However, I think is also important for beginner programmers to
      master this project, because this project requires you to have strong understanding and use of conditional statements. At the same time, I had to learn how to 
      place all displaying objects at the correct coordinate.

    <h3 class="summary">
      Over the course of this project, I've learned and came aross many obstacles. One of the reason is that I don't have physics, and I had a hard time learning 
      as a rookie. However, Khan Academy has simple and easy to understand instructions for beginners like me, I eventually made the code to work, and I enjoyed 
      the learning process of this project.

    <h3  class="summary">
      During this project, I've learned that SQL is easy to understand and can be helpful for my future projects. The main idea of this project is to 
      create my own store, this online store will contain item names, item quantity and prices. This can be useful for future projects when I need to 
      store variables or anything in an library, and I can select any variables I want from the library any time, All users need to do is to use the 
      Select statement.

    <h3  class="summary">
      The Starfield is the Summative for this course. The main idea for this summative is to teach my classmates to code this game/display. Over the course
      of the lesion preparation, I had to search up history, mathematics and of course, the Computer Science aspects of the game. Mr.O (my Computer Science teacher)
      required me and my partner to create a github website to store all the information about Starfield. Me and my partner had to learn and have deep understanding of
      both background context of Starfield, and how to code Starfield. Me and my partner didn't just finished the project/summative, we also knowledged ourselves to all 
      the aspects relates to Starfield, <a href="https://github.com/XLJasonHuo/Starfield">Here's the link to our github, feel free to check it out!</a>

    <!--Computer Science: Programming-->
    <h1 class = "project">Computer Science: Programming</h1>  
    <img id="ssMastery" src="Mastery Pic.png">
    <h3  class="summary">
        In my opinion, I think is important for beginners to finish and master this module at Khan Academy. The reason why I say this is because first,
        Khan Academy gives clear instructions and insights to programming, not just this module, but all content inside the website. Second, I think 
        that this module contains fundamentals of coding, sessions such as: Variables, Strings, Conditionals, Lists... Could give beginners like me a 
        fine, easy to understand introduction to the world of coding. Although I took Computer Science classes before starting this module, i had a 1 year
        time period where I took a break from coding, and I was focusing on other subjects in school, this introduction module essentially helped me to knock
        the cobwebs off, which gave me confidence in the future advanced modules.

    <!--Freecodecamp Progress-->
    <h1 class="project">FCC (Freecodecamp)</h1>
    <img id="fcc" src="fcc.png">
    <h3 class="summary">
      Sadly, I didn't have time to finish all the modules, but I completed the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification. My experience on FCC was way 
      different than compare to Khan Academy. I personally like Khan Academy more, however, as a student, I think is important to have multiple ways to learn about 
      certain subjects. I recommend beginner programmers to try out multiple coding websites, because sometimes people may find themselves work better with 
      certain websites. I had a good time on Freecodecamp, the instructions were clear and simple, lesions were effective.

    <h2 id = "QandA">Computer Science Q & A</h2>
    
    <!--Question 1-->
    <h3 class="question">
      What should one take note of on your portfolio?
    </h3>
    <br>
    <h3 class="answer">
      There're two things I want the viewers especially beginner programmers to take notes of from my website. First, the design, In my opinon, I think that my website 
      has a good design and theme. Second, the theme of this website. I think that the main idea of this project/website is to share with others what've doned and learned in this course, and 
      share the experiences of my learning process to beginners, hopefully they can learn not to step into holes that I stepped in, use and learn from positive and helpful websites 
      that I found helpful (Khan Academy, Freecodecamp).

    <br>

    <!--Question 2-->
    <h3 class="question">
      What does it mean to have good programming practices?
    </h3>
    <br>
    <h3 class="answer">
      "Practice makes perfect." This phrase is a thing for a reason. I think as beginner programmers we have to practice everytday, until we feel confortable with our
      coding abilities. To do that, we have to find our weak points, let's say that I'm bad at drawing on the canvas, I would find or create topics/questions for myself 
      to practice on, like math. This is why earlier at the FCC I said that as students, is really important to have multiple ways of learning. Although different websites 
      are teaching us the same content/concept, but during that learning process, we as students will gain deeper knowledge or even strengthen our muscle memory of certain
      topics. I would suggest beginner programmers to research useful websites and resources, and share thoese resources on the internet, let other new programmers to learn 
      better and more comfortably :)

    <br>

    <!--Qustions 3-->
    <h3 class="question">
      How will you continue learning about computer science?
    </h3>
    <br>
    <h3 class="answer">
      Like I said on my introduction, I'm planning on doing Computer Science related post-secondary educations. So I would continue work on Khan Academy, I would switch Khan Academy
      to a hobby rather than a schoolwork website. I would continue searching for new resources and websites for me to learn, join programming clubs such as coding club in my school
      to share my information with others, hopefully I can help them and they can help me :)

    <!--Conclusion-->
    <h2 id="end">In Conclusion...</h2>
    <h3>
      It has been a difficult year for everyone as we speak (2021/01/20). Thankfully, computer science can adapt into a online class easier than other classes, I didn't have much problems
      under the lockdown. I've learn many content from Khan Academy, Freecodecamp and many more sources, I enjoyed working with my peers and teachers, I had fun making the projects and I 
      was so happy to get to share them to my peers, teachers and now the internet. i will continue work on my programming skills, I enjoy coding and computer related content. At the end, 
      I hope everyone is surviving this virus, stay safe, wash your hands, you know the deal ;), Jason Huo here, signing out.......
