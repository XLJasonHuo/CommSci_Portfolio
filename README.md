# Computer Science Portfolio 2020 ~ 2021

### Hey there, welcome to my github :) My name is Jason Huo, I'm a aspired computer science beginner, I'm planning to enhance my skills and abilities at Computer Science related subjects post-secondary. Over this quadmester, I've lerned many technologies/techniques from multiple different languages. In this website, I'll showcase some of the projects and challenges I've done and obstacles I came across,  <a href="https://github.com/XLJasonHuo/CommSci_Portfolio/tree/main/Code">here's the link to my code</a>. Outside of the world of coding, I'm a person that loves to go outside, I love soccer/football, cars are my passion. My code will also cover my top 10 personal favorite projects during my time in Khan Academy and other applications. A paragrah/s of summary which will follow each project, this will include my thoughts on I would use this technique/technology to learn future Computer Science subjects; How and what aspects of the moduule made the most impact as a student. Without further ado, let's dive into the world of coding. ;)
